libscheme is a C library implementing Scheme as described in the
Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.  It is easily
integrated into a C program as a command interpreter or extension
langauge, and is easily extended in C with new primitive types,
primitve functions and syntax.

See BUGS for known bugs.
See INSTALL for installation information.
See COPYING for copyright information.
See TODO for possible projects.
See EXTENSIONS for extensions beyond R4RS.
See USING for information on using libscheme in a project.
